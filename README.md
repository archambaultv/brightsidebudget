# Brightside Budget

ðŸŽ¶ Always look on the bright side of your finance ðŸŽ¶

Brightside budget is my personal python library to manage my finance. Expect
this library to be opinionated and tailored to my needs with frequent changes.

## Overview of the library

The data are stored in CSV files, and the library offers a Journal class. The
Journal class encompasses a collection of accounts, postings, balance
assertions, along with various methods to manipulate these objects.

I use CSV files because they are straightforward to work with in Excel and are
easy to version control with Git.
